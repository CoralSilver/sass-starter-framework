This is the starting styles/ architecture I use for building out css frameworks for new projects. It promotes object-oriented CSS, and is written in SCSS using BEM notation.

It takes ideas from SKYLINE: https://github.com/crushlovely/skyline and http://bitters.bourbon.io/ and is heavily inspired by the work and writings of Harry Roberts, Chris Coyier, Brad Frost, Jonathan Snook, and Nicole Sullivan.

It is an evolving work in progress.
